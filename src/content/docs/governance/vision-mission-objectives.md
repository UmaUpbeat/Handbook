# 🌄 Vision

> _“Empower every educator, trainer and facilitator on Earth to create and deliver interactive learning—​from a three-question exit ticket to a full 2.5-D game show—​without vendor lock-in, licence fees, or technical barriers.”_

# 🧭 Mission

Uma Upbeat exists to:

1. **Deliver a single, open-source engine** that runs **both cloud-scale and offline-from-a-USB**.
2. **Accept any content** via **plain-text import** (`@OPENQUIZ`) and turn it into quizzes, polls, or games in seconds.
3. **Offer pluggable AI** that respects privacy (local-first, opt-in).
4. **Ship high-fidelity experiences**—60 fps, ≤ 3 MB, touch-first—on any mobile device.
5. **Operate under transparent, community-led governance** that guarantees perpetual freedom.
